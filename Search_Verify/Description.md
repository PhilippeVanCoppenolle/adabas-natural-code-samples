These functions do the same as PL/1 functions "SEARCH()" and "VERIFY()".
SEARCH(P_STRING, P_SEARCH) will return the position of the first character in P_STRING which can be found in P_SEARCH.
VERIFY(P_STRING, P_VERIFY) will return the position of the first character in P_STRING which does NOT occur in P_VERIFY.
